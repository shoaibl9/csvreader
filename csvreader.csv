9/10/2021 11:23:33,Dow Constantine,info@dowconstantine.com,DowConstantine.com,King County Executive,"In June 2020, I joined Public Health Director Patty Hayes in declaring racism a public health crisis. Working with a core team of predominantly Black, Brown, and Indigenous employees, I proposed an Anti-Racist Policy Agenda and funded community groups to share expertise and hone the agenda to ensure we were prioritizing the right actions. Now, through COVID recovery efforts, we are funding tens of millions of investments supporting that agenda.

This is our chance to rethink our economy as we recover from COVID. Using federal American Rescue Plan dollars, I have created a $630 million COVID economic recovery plan approved by the King County Council and already being used to revitalize the economy and protect our most vulnerable. By focusing on public health, community supports, and jobs and economic recovery, we will transform this crisis into an opportunity, leveraging this unprecedented investment to make a permanent and positive difference for all in King County.

Developed with community input, key specific investments include: over $100 million in rental assistance for those in need; $25 million for BIPOC businesses and economic resiliency; $20 million supporting creative economy organizations and $11 million for an arts recovery fund; over $10 million for new construction apprenticeships and job training; $9 million for unincorporated King County small business grants and permitting; $6 million for food security, including funding a food-hub and supporting community-based organizations to purchase culturally-appropriate foods; $5 million to track and target hate and bias; $1 million creating economic pathways for young people involved in gun violence.

These investments support communities of color, immigrant, and refugee communities, and help create foundations for long-term success and stability. Moving forward, I’ll continue to listen to those voices and prioritize a truly equitable recovery responding to the specific needs of our neighbors and communities.","In response to the rising violence mentioned above, King County joined with community to form the Coalition Against Hate and Bias. The coalition was founded to strengthen community through visibility, reporting, data collection, education, and support and empowerment for those affected by bigotry and xenophobia. Driven and led by community, the coalition operates separately from law enforcement –neighbors support one another. I’m grateful the Muslim Community & Neighborhood Association is one of our coalition partners in this effort.

I’ve announced $5 million in emergency funding to track and combat hate and bias crimes in King County, including funding for multi-language media outlets.

Community buy-in is important, but authentic input, based on life experience, is most valuable for creating successful policy. Listening to stakeholder organizations and affected communities is how we’re best able to address the priorities of the refugee and immigrant communities. Our King County Immigrant and Refugee Commission is composed of members who are from, work with, and live in immigrant and refugee communities. These include members like Lalita Uppala (who leads Indian American Community Services), who described her work with the commission as “being a conduit between King County… and the immigrant and refugee communities that reside in it.”

King County recently reached the 70% mark for vaccinations across all racial and age groups, the first county of its size to achieve this feat. This was only possible due to partnership between King County Public Health and trusted community groups. By allowing community leaders and organizations to address their community with a culturally appropriate approach and language, we’ve been remarkably successful. This is the same method we’ve embraced to expand access to programs like affordable healthcare and bus passes. There remains more to do, but we are on the right path because of this genuine commitment to community partnership.","As Executive, I will act on the voter mandated responsibility to enact significant reforms in the King County Sheriff’s Office with a department that embraces and reflects the values of King County and its residents, and ensures all communities truly feel welcome and safe.

Under my leadership, we worked directly with impacted communities and families who have lost loved ones due to police violence in designing a new inquest process that will ensure real and increased accountability for the sheriff’s department. This will continue to be my approach – working alongside communities of color and criminal legal system reform advocates and experts, we will transform our policing systems to ensure everyone feels safe in King County.

Now, I am looking to the community at-large and our search committee (Public Safety Advisory Committee) to develop the changes to our King County Sheriff’s office that I will be presenting to the King County Council for approval. Of the 13 members of PSAC, 11 are from overpoliced, impacted communities, reform organizations, and oversight committees, and 2 represent police staff.

Some of my priorities for transparency and accountability include ensuring body cameras for every sheriff’s officer, a transparent hiring and discipline process for officers, new teams with social workers and behavioral-health experts so officers aren’t responding to emergencies where they aren’t needed, reviewing past practices, and regular, frequent community engagement.

Finally, appointing a sheriff who shares and is accountable to these values and sets the tone for the entire department will be crucial. This decision will occur with the extensive input of community and thorough exploration of candidates to ensure we make the right choice – committed to accountability, transparency, community co-creation, and safety for all.","While King County does not supervise public education, I recognize the important role and opportunity we have to shape the direction and outcomes of future learning for our region’s kids. That’s why I originated and led ‘Best Starts for Kids’—the most comprehensive approach to healthy child development in the nation, investing in equitable support for children, youth and young adults, funding free school clinics, and working with 500 community organizations.

This year, through the levy renewal, we’re adding 3000 spots for quality, subsidized child care, which will help give kids, many Black, the foundation and support they need to grow up happy, healthy, safe and thriving—to succeed in school, and in life. Every child deserves the strong foundation, with mentorship and community guidance along the way, needed to reach adulthood healthy and ready to excel.

Through Best Starts for Kids, and through diversion efforts, we are investing millions into community-based organizations serving Black youth, supporting education and restorative justice in schools while specifically fighting the school-to-prison pipeline. For example, our Restorative Community Pathways program will divert 800 youth away from the criminal legal system completely. 

We will continue to advocate for the Legislature to increase investment in our students, and work with local school boards to promote programs that best serve underrepresented youth. But we’re also not going to wait, and will further take the lead through Best Starts and other programs that make an immediate and lasting impact in the lives of King County’s youth.","There is no doubt that the rapid development of surveillance software can and will be used to unfairly target communities of color and pry into the lives of the most marginalized in our society. That’s why this year King County became the first county in the nation to ban the use of facial recognition software. We know – and it’s statistically proven – that this kind of software is racially biased and inaccurate, and runs the risk of abuse and overuse. Our ban prohibits the Sheriff’s Department from using this kind of software.

Unlike my opponent, who wrote a bill allowing the continued use of this surveillance software against the vocal opposition of civil rights organizations like the ACLU, in King County and under my leadership, we are putting the rights and privacy of our people above the profits of technology companies.

As similar kinds of technologies continue to develop, we will work with the most impacted to determine what uses are appropriate for government use. We have an obligation to consider the disparate impact of biometric and AI technologies, which will not affect all communities the same way. We are an innovative and forward-looking region, and it’s for that reason that I am confident we can adopt the latest technologies when and where appropriate, and do so with equity and justice at the forefront, informed by the very communities who know best.","Engaging with the Muslim community has been a major priority for our campaign and for my office, and I’m proud to have attended and led multiple events with leaders and neighbors from King County’s Muslim community. For example, in response to the pandemic, I worked with Muslim community partners to distribute masks and host vaccine pop up clinics. I’ve also visited the Muslim American Youth Foundation in Burien to learn more about their work in community and how we can best support those efforts. And, in September, my campaign will be joining a Muslim prayer and community event.

Our office has also worked with the Muslim community to support and grow shared community spaces, for example, providing funding for the Mall of Africa and supporting displaced businesses to create a cultural and economic hub for Somali-owned businesses in South King County.

As the war in Afghanistan comes to an end, we will work to support Afghan refugees and ensure they receive the support they need as they arrive in King County.

For continued success in this office, I know how important it is to meet with our diverse communities where they are. Hearing directly from King County’s Muslim communities, I look forward to learning how we can address their needs and then continuing to put those priorities into action."
8/31/2021 15:33:48,Joe Nguyen,joe@meetjoenguyen.com,meetjoenguyen.com,King County Executive,"Raised on social services in King County, I had an especially close look into the impact that our policies and leadership has on working families. I also know that all of these issues are delicately interconnected,  and when our most marginalized are given the support and opportunity to thrive, we all benefit. Because of that experience, I sounded the alarm early on calls for budget cuts in the midst of the pandemic, and led the way on building a no-austerity budget with COVID relief packages that will help our communities when they need it most. 
This is a time to start investing in people. Homelessness, gun violence, and lack of economic mobility are all because the government has not prioritized the basic needs of everyday people. I have done the work, been out in the community, and built coalitions to fight for my core priorities listed on my website. My entire leadership style is grounded in shared power, bringing in those most impacted into the decision making processes.","We need to be proactive about responding to the needs of immigrant communities and communities of color. Instead of waiting until the problem has been exacerbated or until we're in crisis mode, we need to be prepared for and anticipate needs. Genuinely engaging community and listening to their needs must be an ongoing process in order to build real trust. 
We are currently in the midst of a refugee crisis with people from Afghanistan fleeing to the United States, including King County. We must provide in-person resources by contracting with nonprofits which currently serve refugee and middle eastern communities + ensure government-subsidized housing is available for families to have a safe place to call home. Social workers who can work with family members to sign up for basic government services such as food stamps + free transit. Finally, having in language news, TV, and other grounding + community building resources are key to making folks feel safe, welcome, + connected. 
","This issue is at the crossroads of our broken justice system. Simply put, we are asking the King County Sheriff’s office to do too much, + we have to create an internal cultural shift within departments. Having armed police officers responding to non-violent misdemeanors + mental health crises unnecessarily escalates situations to the point of violence. King County needs to cede away some of the responsibilities currently in the hands of KCSO + give them to trained social workers + community groups. Specifically, KCSO should no longer be conducting traffic stops or handling episodes of mental distress and addiction. I proposed a bill last session to ban police from pretextual + traffic stops, + I’d like to follow through with that in King County as well. 
The King County OLEO has a vital role to play in holding bad actors in law enforcement accountable for their behavior + maintaining transparency. Their continued oversight needs to be supported through whatever mechanism is necessary.","Currently, schools are funded based on the property taxes of the community around them. Neighborhoods facing historical redlining and underinvestments mean lower property values and as a result, lower property taxes paid into their local schools. The solution here is NOT raising property values or taxes in historically underfunded school districts. Rather, the solution here is aggregating funding for school and dispersing fairly. 
We need to change how our schools are funded. We need to dismantle our segmented school funding system which allows schools in wealthy neighborhoods to be much better funded than schools in historically redlined neighborhoods. Instead, we should be pooling property taxes into district-wide funds which school districts can then distribute in an equitable way, based on historical funding, the number of students at each school, and the variety of electives available at each school. ","I’m proud to have written the nation’s first bill on facial recognition, restricting how state agencies can use facial recognition technology and requiring law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant before they can use facial recognition technology as part of a criminal investigation. This bill ensures that facial recognition technology is used with concerns for the moral implications that come with them by implementing regulatory checks and balances, and as our technology evolves, so should our bills. I'll be keeping a close eye on this issue, and use my background in tech and governance to ensure our laws regulate these tools in the most equitable and effective way possible. ","Personally, I have been actively volunteering to support refugees from Afghanistan coming to King County. Campaign-wise, I have built strong relationships with organizations and individuals which serve Muslim communities, and am always looking for further ways to engage and bring folks in. "
9/1/2021 21:58:19,Sally Caverzan,ElectSallyCaverzan@gmail.com,www.ElectSallyC.com,King County Council District 1,"I would describe my post-Covid recovery plan to be Green and Humanitarian.
One area of concern is the eldercare industry where a majority of workers are immigrants and women of color. It is an under-compensated profession. There are homecare deserts in King County where seniors are not able to get an aide due to cumbersome travel. A homecare worker may ride a bus an hour each way for just a 4 hour shift. Not sustainable. 
At the County Level, we could provide free ORCA cards/credits for HCAs. The safety of an entire population of vulnerable disabled adults counts on these skilled workers being able to get to them. 

A NEW King County Conservation Corps. This program would help households at risk of eviction or utility shut-off to contribute to the public good in exchange for utility credits or rental credits paid directly to landlords. With eviction moratoriums coming to an end we need a longer term solution to prevent gentrification. 
","While many people are ready to beat-down the vaccine hesitant, I have much compassion for people of color. The Tuskegee Syphilis experiment lasted into the 1970s. That historical context that was not taught to us in school has been a cautionary tale passed through the experience of the people who lived it. It is an important dark history that by simply refusing to teach it, reinforces valid distrust in the system. When we teach about the wrongs of the past, that acknowledgement demonstrates our communal commitment to “never again.” 
Research proves that health outcomes for black men are improved when they have a physician of color. These patients are more likely to accept preventative screenings and vaccines in general. I believe that the most effective way to get the vaccine out to hesitant BIPOC folks is representation in delivery. Vaccination worker recruitment from the community of intended recipients is the fastest ways to overcome the perceived outsider threat.
"," My vision of police reform starts with mental health. PRO-active, not RE-active. ALL law enforcement need undergo minimal mental health counseling hours annually, not just those in hot water after an incident. Most therapists say if a counselor tells you they don’t personally need a therapist, you should fire them. I believe the same with police. Any police officer with the hubris to believe they do not need mental health therapy (job related or not) is waving a red flag.  
We should be training human service professionals to be police officers and to implement that balance of expertise in response. The affluent areas of North King County have the RADAR program to respond to mental health disturbances, but not the South where more BIPOC populations reside. We need to expand the RADAR program across the County. 

",I believe that the path to healing communities is reparative. I am very open to the idea of a redline-reparation property tax. Meaning that communities that traditionally held racial exclusion covenants would be subject to additional land tax on properties over a TBD value. This exceptional value in the land was reaped upon systemic hate and to the disadvantage of others. Such funds could help off-set the financial/educational/opportunity gap that directly correlates to lower property value,"Technology serves a crucial role in protecting and serving. We know that eye witness reports, even police reports, are subject to inaccuracies or self-serving mistruths. If George Floyd’s murder had not been captured on a cell camera, the Truth would have been lost and the officer’s protected from accountability. Cameras become problematic once they are used to change the truth, to fill in the gaps rather than to fact check. Using facial recognition for black & brown faces yield statistically significant poor results to the extent that I believe that it has the potential for more harm than good. It’s good enough for Amazon Go where lives are not on the line, but not for suspect identification. ","My “campaign” is just me. We need to get the money out of politics thus I have not taken a donation nor affiliated myself to any political party nor their resources. I am able to speak as a home visiting social worker and to reflect upon the crisis in Afghanistan.

I unfortunately anticipate that the forthcoming Afghanistan refugees may not be universally warmly received, creating new/different trauma. One of the only Pashtu communities in King County is in my District. Culturally, these families are private regarding personal matters, making finding a translator for human service purposes difficult. I think it is a reasonable prediction that more Pashtu speaking Afghanis will come to our area. Whether or not they are eligible voters, I view them as constituents and a part of the people I am vying to represent.
"
9/2/2021 15:16:50,Sarah Perry,sarah@electsarahperry.org,www.electsarahperry.org,King County Council Position 3,"My post COVID recovery plan is comprehensive and helps ensure equity and long-term solutions by getting to the root cause of the challenges we face. My personal values structure is about social inclusion for all, economic opportunity for all and protection of our air, water and land. I am committed to building systems and structures within King County that are equitable and reflect these values as we recover from COVID. 

For example, we have seen clearly that our essential workers have transit stops far from their homes with less convenient schedules in comparison to white-collar workers. Current reductions due to the budget and ridership decreases as a result of the pandemic have further exacerbated the issue and cancelled certain routes altogether, impacting least resourced areas dramatically. I will use my voice and my vote on Council to apply an equity lens to our transit policies and practices to center those with the greatest need. 

In addition, our cities like Redmond and Issaquah are sorely lacking in low-income, affordable and workforce housing, which results in our day-care workers, our nurses, our teachers, our construction workers, our part-time workers and more to live outside of our district and travel great distances for their employment while not being able to live, work, play and raise their families in the same community. I will be a voice for equity in housing as we recover from COVID. 

Finally, in our district, the current incumbent focuses on supporting businesses where there is a personal relationship over time, while many business owners from communities of color, have yet to see the same level of outreach and care from their representative. I am committed to a regional conversation to lift small businesses in each of our communities so that communities can thrive for the greater good, creating opportunity for all. We know that if we work toward equity in housing, transit and jobs, diversity and inclusion will follow.","I want to use my privilege and platform, both during the campaign, and once in office, to address the inequities in our communities by listening, leading or stepping aside as needed and guided in partnership with the Indigenous, refugee, immigrant, Muslim, Hindu, African-American, Latinx communities and other communities of color disproportionately impacted by xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments. I am committed to bringing our communities together to work on community-driven solutions. This includes focusing on education, racial bias training, moving to a system rooted in equity and fair treatment, and electing leaders who serve as role models. The current incumbent has a concerning record on race and equity issues and simply has not shown up for these communities in her 20-year tenure on the council. This needs to change and I am eager to be part of that change. 

I am committed to building a diverse staff and volunteer structure during the campaign. Once in office I am committed to forming a Community Coalition with representative voices from the communities in our district to ensure that County practices and policies that impact the residents in our district are developed and delivered in a way that will reach the members in each of our communities most effectively and equitably. This includes vaccine distribution and expanding language options for vaccine resources. 

I am running to not only be a County Councilmember, but an ally and someone to count on to be responsive, accessible and personally and professionally engaged with the work of justice and equity. I am running for office to bring forward each of our voices for a better future for us all.","As our next King County Councilmember for District 3, I will be a strong voice for policies around transparency, accountability and de-escalation training. I will be a voice and a vote for the transformation needed to ensure ALL communities feel safe in King County – meaning a public safety system that protects Black residents instead of needlessly putting them at risk and in danger because of biased policing. On Council, I will push for responses from social workers and other first responders, in emergency situations, especially those involving behavioral health; advocate for body cameras on all sheriff’s officers; and engage with community members who are most impacted to determine additional reforms and oversight structures.

It is time to have open communication and work together to put the funding, people, and resources into our homeless community, our healthcare system, and our community building. The most important issue is bringing trust and care back into housing, governmental assistance, and aid programs. ","We must fund schools equitably and ensure the wealthiest among us and large corporations pay their fair share. We can then allocate resources to the schools and districts with the greatest need. I also believe we need to prioritize hiring teachers and faculty that reflect the students they serve. I am a strong supporter of prioritizing equity, diversity and inclusion in all of our schools and I support funding for training for teachers, paraeducators and all support staff to change norms and create a space where all are able to recognize intersectionality within the classroom to foster a system that gives each student the resources that they need to thrive. To the extent that I am able to use my platform to vote and advocate in this area, I will always support our teachers, paraeducators and support staff in ensuring that they receive the needed training and culturally relevant materials to be able to reach each child from that child’s racial, ethnic, gender orientation, religious and socio-economic status to help each child to their greatest potential for success.",We must strike a balance between bringing the latest innovations to our schools and sacrificing the privacy and safety of our children. I support a process by which the community and technology experts can review the potential risks and benefits of any new biometric and AI technologies before they’re introduced into the classroom.,"I recently had the opportunity to meet with community members from the Snoqualmie Mosque, where my husband and I were graciously invited to join an evening of fellowship with 15 members including Naveed Jabbar. I also recently had a chance to attend an Eid celebration service at Sammamish Mosque by invitation of Chair Rehan Bashar, and enjoyed the opportunity to get to know community members and build our relationships. Additionally, our campaign has earned the endorsement of Cherif Sidiali, an original founding member of the Sammamish Mosque, and Cherif continues to be an ally and resource for relevant issues that arise in our campaign and is actively engaged in supporting our campaign.

We’ve also reached out to MAPS through Mubarak Elamin requesting the possibility of a community gathering and look forward to working together to listen and learn about the issues that are relevant to the Muslim community and how I can be an effective voice and vote, and can work together toward progress on these issues. In addition, we are actively recruiting a 20-hour per week Field Fellow from within the Muslim community and hope to be able to hire someone soon to support campaign canvassing efforts in the Redmond, Woodinville and Duvall communities.

I will continue to reach out through calls, emails and personal connections and I look forward to continued engagement and collaboration throughout the Muslim communities in Issaquah, Sammamish, Redmond, Woodinville, Duvall, Carnation, Snoqualmie and North Bend. I am committed to learning as much as possible, to building civic engagement in each of our communities, and to ensuring that those most impacted by County policies are invited to the decision-making table where policies have been and are being developed. This vision of engagement is not embraced by the current incumbent who has a go-along, get-along approach and emphasizes long-time individual, one-off relationships over new relationships and the collective good."
9/10/2021 0:29:45,Dave Upthegrove,daveup@comcast.net,www.daveupthegrove.com,King County Council District 5,"King County government can play a meaningful role in our economic recovery, and we do indeed have an opportunity to ""build back better.""  As a regional service provider, King County provides robust human services.  COVID has laid bare existing health disparities and other inequalities, highlighting the need to continue to be intentional in how we spend our limited funds.  Whether our Best Starts for Kids funding, our Veterans Seniors and Human Services Levy funding, or our Mental Illness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) funds, we must build on the progress we have made in targeting them like a laser on addressing inequality. The strategies for the use of these dollars must continue to be developed by and shaped by the communities most impacted. In addition to the robust outreach by the human service agencies, and the use of community advisory committees, I also directly engage the community in my district.  Whenever there are funding plans being developed, I convene conversations with community members and leaders from within communities of color and immigrant and refugees communities in South King County.  I continually seek and build relationships with people or communities who have traditionally not been part of decision making, and provide information and opportunities to help shape budget and policy priorities.  My vision is one where King County is providing mental health services, child care support, transportation, and housing assistance in an equitable manner and at a more robust level.  This basic ""human infrastructure"" is the key to building stability and economic opportunity for all-- including immigrant communities and communities of color.  County government alone can't do it all; we need to continue to advocate in partnership with community at the state and federal level as well.  The great Bishop Desmond Tutu famously noted that ""hope is being able to see the light despite the darkness.""  I have hope that out of this tragedy comes opportunity.","Throughout the pandemic I convened regular meetings on zoom with leaders from immigrant/refugee organizations in South King County to work together to identify immediate needs and solutions. This community engagement shaped my budget and policy priorities. These community conversations directly led to (1) my successful budget amendment to include culturally relevant food assistance, (2) my budget amendment to expand digital access grants beyond K-12 to also include adult members of the immigrant/refugee community, (3) my budget amendment to extend funding for the Coalition Against Hate & Bias-- a community-led initiative to address hate and bias incidents by strengthening and networking communities who experience racist and bigoted treatment, and (4) most notably, my successful work to change the rental assistance program to ensure smaller cultural organizations can directly access assistance dollars for their clients (rather than have it all go through the United Way). I also do everything I can to recognize my position of power and privilege as a councilmember to speak out-- joining community in the streets at rallies, and using my official office communication to reinforce clear messages of inclusion and respect.

Having invested the time to build authentic relationships and trust within immigrant & refugee communities in South King County, I will continue this same approach moving forward. The needs of the community will continue to shape my priorities. Right now, a top priority to ensure health, safety and wellbeing is to help provide access to housing, by supporting extensions of eviction moratoriums, continuing to provide funding for rental assistance, and working with community-led organizations to develop long-term community-owned affordable housing.  We also need to continue our community partnerships with trusted messengers from within specific cultural communities to help share public health information. Translation is important but not enough.","The murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police elevated an important national movement. This movement is about justice: justice for black people, justice for indigenous people, and justice for people of color.

My firm belief this: when justice is a reality for all black indigenous and people of color, we will have taken a gigantic leap forward, toward justice for all. 
 
Delivering justice means rooting out the institutional racism embedded not only in law enforcement, but throughout the criminal justice system. It means that people are safe and actually feel safe in their communities and homes. 
 
Delivering justice means listening to the voices of those most impacted by injustice. 

That’s why staying connected to community has always been so important to me, and why I have been focused on listening. 

What I’m hearing from our black indigenous and people of color neighbors in South King County is a desire to:

Demilitarize the police;

Further restrict the use of deadly or excessive force by police;

Strengthen civilian oversight of the King County Sheriff’s Office, including independent investigation authority and subpoena power;

Improve the inquest process for families of police shooting victims;

Increase investments in youth to end the school-to-prison pipeline;

And find savings in our traditional police budgets to invest instead in community-based approaches proven effective at delivering justice and ensuring everyone is safe.
 
If justice is to be delivered, these recommendations must be enacted.

At the King County Council, we are now to putting these recommendations into a bold agenda for change. 
 
I don’t want any of my neighbors in South King County to live in fear or feel that their voices are not valued.  I will continue to stand up for our shared values. 
","Every child deserves access to a world class education, but sadly too many students are continuing to struggle.  When we look at which students are struggling, we see gaps in achievement based on race.  We see gaps in achievement based on national origin. And most notably we see gaps in achievement based on income.  These achievement gaps are not do to differences in ability; they are due to differences in opportunity. Closing the achievement gaps in education is the civil rights issue of our time. King County is a national leader as a regional government in investing in young people-- through our Best Starts For Kids initiative-- and we need to continue to focus those dollars on early childhood education programs and other youth programs in an equitable manner, meaning continuing to target resources based on need (which as you noted is greatest among low-income students and students of color). We need to continue to invest more in youth organizations led-by, centered-in, and serving communities of color.","We must use every tool at our disposal to protect the privacy and civil liberties of everyone in our community.  While the authority of county government is limited, we recently took an important first step by passing legislation (which I was proud to sponsor) to prohibit the use of facial recognition technology by county government entities, such as the King County Sheriffs Department.  We are one of the first local governments to take this affirmative step. I have worked with the ACLU in the past to explore legislation to require a defined uniform process for county government approval of new technologies. Such a process would require county departments, including county law enforcement, to receive County Council approval to implement any technologies that collect personal information of any kind.  The process would include an analysis of equity impacts, as well as a meaningful public process. We need to be more transparent and provide greater oversight, and I am interested in pursuing this idea.","I have meet individually and in small groups in the community with members of Muslim communities.  I also have visited Mosques, with more visits planned.  I have a number of Muslim volunteers who have been helping with doorbelling and other activities. My work in the community with Muslim leaders and organizations in South King County over the last eight years has helped shape my priorities and agenda for the next four years. This means continuing to respect and welcome all faiths and continuing to be a passionate voice against Islamophobia and other forms of hate."
9/10/2021 16:51:12,Shukri Olow,info@electshukriolow.com,https://www.electshukriolow.com/,"King County, Council District 5","The economic downturn caused by COVID-19 caused a rush to get government funding lifelines out the door as fast as possible, which meant that many Women and Minority Owned Business Enterprises (WMBE) and organizations were left behind. As we recover from the economic impact of the pandemic, we must prioritize equitable outreach with the voices of WMBE to understand how these disparities have impacted their ability to thrive, and pass laws and increase investments to address these inequities.

Business immigrant and BIPOC owned businesses that have not been able to access federal support such as restaurants and family-owned small businesses are an area of focus for us to provide rental and leasing assistance, funding for recovery and health and safety investments, and other supports for their COVID resilience. Similarly, we want to ensure the labor rights and working conditions for daily wage laborers and frontline workers – which are made up disproportionately of immigrant and BIPOC workers.","In early February, as the COVID-19 vaccine began rolling out to the public, our campaign help an event attended by nearly 600 community members titled, ““Y’all getting vaccinated?: A talk about racism, medicine, COVID-19 vaccines, and the Black community,” to educate and hear from community members on their concerns about the vaccine during this public health crisis.

According to King County, besides South East King County, District 5 has some of the lowest vaccination rates. We need to work with culturally competent community partners to ensure the safety of our neighbors.","Above all, we must recognize that our criminal justice system is deeply unjust and structurally inequitable - especially for BIPOC communities. We stand firmly with the #BlackLivesMatter movement and in solidarity with local families impacted by police violence, and recently held a town hall with impacted families to talk about solutions to the issues of accountability.

Our goal is to reimage public safety with a public health lens. This means leading with restorative models grounded in comprehensive wrap-around services, multiplying support in our existing alternatives to incarceration, and increasing public investments in living-wage, community jobs. When we treat all social determinants contributing to incarceration, we can sustainably dismantle the underlying root causes to legal involvement and intergenerational incarceration, rather than making surface level changes that do not lead to long-term reduction in disparities and inequities.

Our campaign knows one of the biggest hurdles in holding the King County Sheriff’s office accountable (as well as the local police departments in the several cities in our district) is how we ensure that bargaining with law enforcement does not perpetuate or deepen the historic lack of accountability for officers that commit wrong and jeopardize community trust and safety.

We need to establish truly independent community oversight above and beyond the County’s Office of Law Enforcement Oversight which is a part of the negotiations process for the Collective Bargaining Agreement that governs labor policy with the Sheriff’s Office and King County Police Officers’ Guild.

Applying a racial justice lens in the bargaining process doesn’t mean giving law enforcement carte blanche to determine their own accountability structures - and that community-based organizations with historic, direct experience in restorative justice will lead the conversation in determining what safety looks like in their communities, not officers.","While the King County Council does not have jurisdiction over the several school districts that are located in District 5 (Highline, Renton, Tukwila, Kent), I am committed to ensuring that schools have supplemental supports and upstream investments that are proven to help students thrive. In my current work with Best Starts for Kids as Program Manager I support efforts to invest in promotion and prevention work spanning 31 community based organizations who serve about 5,000 families per month.

My priorities are reflective of community and my lived and professional experience with a human services background across multiple sectors including refugee resettlement, housing, workforce development, school partnerships, and managing prenatal to five programs. I have direct experience working with families in schools as the Schools and Community Partnerships Coordinator with Seattle Public Schools.

Additionally, we need to address youth violence as a social disease and engage with local school district partners, mobilize the community to inform elected leaders about resource gaps contributing to social determinants of violence, and build the capacity of guardians to work with school partners to ensure the safety of young people in our community.

The solutions are clear, we need to increase funding for afterschool programs, youth enrichment, and a public health response that can provide culturally responsive materials to address young people who have risks for firearm violence. I will prioritize our youth as an elected official.","As an immigrant, former refugee, and Black Muslim woman I know what it’s like for the state to use the power of surveillance against me and my community. I will work to ensure that our privacy is not compromised under the guise of security; and that local authorities such as the King County Sheriff’s office – which as mentioned above disproportionately target black and brown communities – do not have access to technologies that perpetuate historic injustice or racial profiling.

I am encouraged by the recent decision by the King County Council to pass a measure that bans the use of facial recognition technology. I would seek to expand that measure with something similar to what the City of Seattle passed in 2018 requiring the agencies, and the Sheriff’s Office in particular, to request approval before acquiring or using any surveillance technologies.","Engagement with Muslim communities is one of the primary focuses on our campaign. Every Friday we visit with and engage with mosques in our district. So far we have engaged with 14 different mosques and plan to run a GOTV strategy to encourage our Muslim neighbors to vote.

In June, we held an event called ""Faith Leaders in Action"" with Imam Abdirahman Kariye (Islamic Center of Bothell), Rev. Jan Bolerjack (Riverton Park Untd Methodist Church), and Rev. Bianca Davis-Lovelace (REACH) to connect leaders of different faiths and talk about what communities on the ground are experiencing across King County during the pandemic."
9/10/2021 11:26:16,Kim-Khanh Van,kimkhanh10@gmail.com,ElectKimKhanhVan.com,King County Council District 9,"I’ve focused on serving vulnerable communities and connecting those in need to resources and services throughout the pandemic. On the County Council, I will base my agenda on the principles of recovery, opportunity, and community – rebuilding from COVID-19 by creating a more equitable region.

Working families, small businesses, immigrants, and more deserve a recovery plan with specific outreach and measures to cater to their needs. We have to use this opportunity to think boldly and address longstanding challenges that have held our county back.

The county should act to restore transit services and deliver equitable investments in South County transportation to better connect communities to education, economic opportunity, and each other. In addition, I will prioritize building affordable housing to lower costs and address homelessness with compassion and evidence-based services that help unsheltered neighbors get back on their feet.

This moment is our chance to build a stronger foundation for truly safe and healthy communities – where we address injustice head-on, protect and expand access to rights and care, and improve access to clean air and water for every resident. Inclusion and equity for vulnerable and historically marginalized communities must be at the center of our recovery efforts.","As a refugee and immigrant myself, and as someone immersed in this work as an immigration attorney, the health and safety of immigrant communities is incredibly important to me. We face a pandemic where immigrants are much more likely to contract COVID and lose wages than other residents. The government has a responsibility to step up and offer needed support.

I will use my background, lived experience, and connections to this community to ensure that our pandemic recovery supports immigrants and is accessible by immigrants. I will focus on targeted outreach that makes resources accessible regardless of language spoken or immigration status. We must protect the small businesses that immigrants have created and the jobs those businesses provide.","The tragic loss of life and threat of police violence does unconscionable harm to our communities of color. This is an issue I will take head-on if elected to the County Council. I will bring a needed new perspective informed by communities of color, youth leaders, and my own lived experience as an immigrant and refugee, along with a governing approach committed to creating real change through innovative programs, organizing neighbors, and consistent leadership.

Immediate efforts should focus on required use of and investment in body cameras and further de-escalation training; increased community oversight; urgent implementation of recently passed state reforms; and changing tactics to rely on social workers in emergency situations where police are not needed.

Black Lives Matter, and I will work hand-in-hand with community leaders and organizations to institute changes that ensure everyone in our community feels safe, drawing on the County Council’s voter-mandated responsibility to implement changes in the sheriff’s department. The County Council has a critical opportunity to set a new standard for accountability and transparency, but this will not happen without strong, attentive leaders on the council.","My experience as a refugee in America taught me that communities coming together to support those disadvantaged by class, systemic oppression, and circumstance makes all the difference in the world. Now, I serve as co-PTA President at my son’s public school. This has allowed me a wonderful experience in building partnerships and rewarding environments with parents and teachers alike within the school community my son is a part of.

I attended public school and believe that we need to address the inequities that exist in our schools today. I am proud to be putting all my children through public school but I do believe we can and must do better. Funding our schools must be delivering equitable investments that fight for all our students regardless of income, zip code, race, or nationality.


On the County Council, I will be a strong supporter of programs that benefit kids and support our public schools. For example, ensuring that expanded access to childcare funded through Best Starts for Kids is implemented equitably, and that programs serving youth promote learning and reduce exposure to the criminal legal system through diversion. It’s time for our government to make an effort towards the equitable opportunities it claims to provide. If elected, I will lead the charge for an equitable reallocation of public school funding on the King County Council.","The ethics, intricacies, and implications of AI and biometrics technology policy are a field I am still learning about – but I am committed to ensuring we do right by our local communities and reduce bias rather than extenuate it. I will consult with experts and stakeholders to make informed decisions as a County Councilmember.

Technology and AI are rapidly developing and complex domains. I believe it is crucial to gain a comprehensive grasp on them so that our government is ensuring our best practices and ethics match our values. We know that the development and implementation of new technologies such as these often leave out the voices of those most impacted, including communities of color. That’s why I will stand with leaders in the community to set strong standards for these kinds of programs that prevent abuse.","It is my priority to engage and listen to communities to represent all of my constituents compassionately. I have cultivated a diverse campaign team that includes members of the Muslim community, and we have engaged at community and mosque celebrations, from the Somali Bantu Community to the Pakistani Community.

I attended Mosques of Kent and Federal Way to get to know our neighbors and their priorities and attended Pakistan's Independence Day Celebration with our Muslim neighbors in the greater Bellevue. I also attended a fundraiser to help the Indus Hospital Network raise funds to help those in need who are Muslims. Currently, I'm setting up monthly workshops at the two mosques to provide pro bono legal work for neighbors to support citizenship and immigration, and other legal matters. 

I look forward to engaging with and learning from Muslim communities on the campaign and as a County Councilmember."

I support improving transportation and potentially free transportation for low-income households who qualify. I support expanding internet access and making it accessible to historically underserved communities. The pandemic showed us the importance of universal broadband, especially for an equitable education. I support school meal programs, which Bellevue has done very well to enable families dependent on school meals to have proper nutrition for their children. I support helping day care centers recover and after school programs so that working parents don't have to worry about their children.","As an Asian-American I worry about the xenophobia related to COVID, and understand how immigrant communities used to a different setting and level of trust in their government can hesitate to participate in government programs.  For the first I believe that creating avenues of cultural exchange helps people see each other as humans and fellow neighbors, instead of stereotypes; in position I would support events and forums where people could share their culture, and support investment in city facilities that do so.  For the second part, I would work on making sure translation services are available so that immigrant communities can access city services.  I would also work with the leaders from minority communities to reach out and share the message as I understand people can trust their own community leaders more than just the government.  ","I am in favor of police accountability, including body cameras, separate crisis response teams, training in non-violent de-escalation methods, and transparency with police metrics.  I am glad for the recent legislation that disallows police officers from simply switching to a different town or city when they are fired, so that bad cops don't just go around.  I support Sen. Patty Kuderer's legislation to increase the education requirements for police officers or substitute years of social work and community service for those education requirements.  ",As mentioned above I am in favor of crisis response teams composed of people with social work backgrounds to work along side community resource officers in schools to provide the social services based response to students experiencing behavioral crises.  Having the city provide a budget for these departments to be funded alongside the police allows us to respond accordingly.,"One of the problems with AI systems today is that they have been developed by, and geared towards a white majority population.  This has resulted in some pre-existing biases being hardcoded into the machine-learning algorithms.  We need to make sure that any applications for AI and face recognition are vetted for racial bias.","As a first time candidate I would love to reach out to all communities, including our Muslim brothers and sisters.

In the near term, although we had a $19 million revenue short-fall, we were able to make up by using our reserve, coupled with Federal funding (ARP) and contributions from major businesses such as Amazon to help the impacted businesses and individuals in unemployment, food, and rental support. We have especially expanded our services to the traditionally under-served populations such as immigrants and communities of color and small businesses who are most impacted. In the longer term, we are working with regional economic organizations, paying special attention to equity, workforce development, especially child care, in consideration of the new hybrid working environment for working families. in addition we are working with business community and organizations like the Chamber and BDA to work on regulations to make it safe and possible to do business. Finally, we have maintained our strong support for public safety to our residents and businesses while making sure we can always do better. We are proud to say that there was no loss of any life and property due to the protest and riot in the one event that took place in Bellevue. We received an excellent report from a consultant we engaged and the police department is studying to make necessary improvements. I am proud to lead and be part of these efforts.    ",I have been doing it by example and using the bully pulpit with the community at large and with the ethnic and immigrant populations I am connected to. Our first responders like Fire and Police are wonderful messengers and ambassadors as well.,"As mentioned earlier in how Bellevue police had performed well and steps taken by the City to insure necessary improvements and is implementing whatever improvements it should adopt, we have also increased funding to make sure Bellevue police continue to be well trained and discharge their duties well. We have added 22 sworn police officers and 5 civilian employees and added enhanced safety training and health safety equipment. ","Bellevue City Council does not have jurisdiction over School policies. We provide School Resource Officers to be the ""friends"" of students when they are young. ""Officer Friendly"" is to make young people comfortable with the police. We want to make sure our SRO's are properly trained to carry out this role. ","Technology, like any tool like sword has two-sided edges that can be used for good or bad. Therefore, it's important we have policies and actual practices to use them for good. I always say that devil is in the detail. As someone who has lived the life and experienced abuse of injustice, neglect, prejudice and discrimination, I can speak out and be heard.",I have served as a Bellevue Councilmember and Mayor for over 27 years. I have friends in the Muslim communities. I treat all people the same with respect and dignity. I have patience to listen to them and address their issues. We need each other's help. We work together to solve our individual problems as well as collective problems and achieve common goals. I am leading a new Council initiative on Cross-Culture communication and problem solving and community building to engage all people of Bellevue to achieve common goals and projects.
9/2/2021 20:17:01,Ruth Lipscomb,ruth@ruthlipscomb.com,www.ruthforbellevue.org,"Bellevue City Council, Position 4","Those who were economically insecure before the pandemic had a much harder time riding it out. Many essential workers didn’t have the option to stay home and thus had to put their health at risk from virus exposure. Many more lost their jobs and even their businesses during the shutdown. My belief is that it’s not enough to restore our neighbors to the economic position they were in before COVID; we need to give them more opportunity and economic stability for the future, so they are better able to handle future setbacks of any scale, from personal to global. All type of relief programs should be extended for as long as needed to stabilize these communities. The programs should at least include rental and mortgage assistance, micro- and small business loans and grants, food assistance, utility subsidies, educational supports, and employment assistance. I would work to make sure that the process to distribute aid through the city of Bellevue is equitable and accessible to all regardless of a recipient’s language, immigration status, or ability to navigate bureaucracy.

I believe in asking the people closest to the problems for their solutions. Community members have their trusted leaders, and my goal is to earn the trust of those leaders and the communities they come from. I would like to take ideas from those affected by problems, and then circle back to show how those ideas have been implemented in the city’s programs. It’s difficult to build relationships in the middle of a crisis but outreach should be continuous and not transactional. As much as possible, I would like to share decision-making power with those who now have the least voice in government.
","First, we must address the xenophobic attacks. We need trusted spaces where our residents can confidentially report incidents and get assistance and referrals. These services must be trauma-informed and culturally relevant. In 2020, the Coalition Against Hate and Bias created such a reporting system; they have collected more reports of biased incidents in the last year than have ever been reported before. This is a sign of both increased incidents and a higher level of trust in the reporting system.

Very soon after it is available in English, crucial pandemic information must be available in the wide range of languages in our region. Our state and county governments should always have translation capacity available, not just for public health information but for any emergency information. Once the information is available, there is a role for cities to focus on the “last mile” to get information to those who may not receive info through other channels. Knowledge can be shared through trusted organizations and leaders. For vaccine hesitancy, again, this is a situation where relationships built and sustained in communities before a crisis can be mobilized in culturally appropriate ways. I would support setting up vaccine mini-clinics in locations like shops, mosques, or churches, and having providers go door-to-door with a community leader in neighborhoods where more residents are hesitant.","Everyone deserves to feel safe in their home and their city. This means that they feel protected from crime but also trust that law enforcement is serving every member of our community. We cannot call our city truly safe if some in our community feel profiled or unwelcome. Bellevue’s police department is very capable, and it can be even better. I will work for more transparency, so the public can see how well the department is meeting its goals around equity and crime reduction. We can also increase accountability by adding more opportunities for residents to weigh in on policing issues and misconduct investigations. Resident input should be part of choosing the next police chief.

I support a holistic view of public safety, so I will advocate to add mental health crisis first responders who can handle calls to 911 that are not criminal in nature. And we must look out for the mental health of our first responders as well, by providing them the support they need.","As a city council member, there is one large school budget item under our control, which is school resource officers. Our schools should be a place where all students can thrive. Many of the black and brown students in Bellevue schools have said that the presence of police officers makes them feel less safe. We can’t ignore these voices just because they are not in the majority. I would explore permanently reassigning officers to non-school duties as has been done temporarily since last year’s school closures.","Surveillance technology can be used for valid goals and yet still have unintentional bias built into the algorithms. Elected leaders at all levels of government must be very careful when deciding which technologies to allow, and weigh whether loss of privacy is worth the benefit to our community. Fortunately, Washington state has more robust privacy protections than many states, but we still must be vigilant to minimize surveillance by both private and government entities. I’m not aware of any surveillance technologies being used by the city of Bellevue other than a handful of red-light cameras and school speed-zone cameras. I support King County’s recent ban of facial recognition software and will advocate for increased privacy protections at the state level.","My campaign has reached out to members of the Muslim community, and I will be participating very soon in a conversation with members of SAATWA (South Asian Americans Together WA.) I look forward to hearing their concerns and ideas for the city, and to continuing conversations in future meetings. I will also participate in a number of candidate forums for both neighborhood associations and community groups and I encourage Muslim residents to participant whenever possible.

I have consistently and personally reached out to immigrant and minority-owned businesses, to offer needed support. As our pandemic recovery continues, I see this as a chance to build back our economy and the strength of our community with these principles at the forefront.

We have supported minority owned businesses with grants and launched Centers Communities of Color to ensure all voices and needs are heard and influence policy. Recovery post-COVID should prioritize the needs of the communities hit the hardest, and immigrants and communities of color have been disproportionately affected. We can achieve this by investing in these communities and building out resources by listening to the community and responding quickly to their needs.  We need the voices of community leaders centered in our recovery efforts.","During the pandemic, we have worked with public health leaders and communities directly to ensure vaccine distribution is swift and equitable, including for those disproportionately at risk, through in-language resources and support for immigrants and non-English speakers, and via mobile vaccination efforts for seniors. As a result, I’m proud that Bellevue has one of the highest rates of vaccination in the state.

The community of Bellevue has shown great resilience through the pandemic and I am proud of the support we have given one another in these times, but we can still make progress towards ending this pandemic together. As a healthcare professional, I believe that everyone should have the resources they need when considering getting vaccinated. Working with community organizations, we have expanded the language options and cultural programs to help increase vaccination resources and rates and I will continue to work to ensure the health of communities is not impeded by cultural obstacles.

Our Hate Has No Home Here campaign, which was broadly adopted by local businesses and residents is a good step in the direction of curbing xenophobia, providing support and resources to those in our City who feel marginalized or threatened due to their race or orientation.","Black Lives Matter. As Mayor, I’ve pledged to eliminate racial bias in policing, identify and challenge systemic racism, and ensure every Bellevue neighbor feels safe and welcome. The Council called for an outside review and full report on the Bellevue Police Department’s use-of-force policies, which we are reviewing and planning to adopt in to prevent police violence. I hope to reimagine our approach to public safety, and am supportive of additional solutions like unarmed, mental health trained workers to respond to emergencies where police aren’t needed.

Moving forward, I will continue to work to make Bellevue a place where people feel welcome and safe by immediately addressing police violence and increasing accountability measures as necessary. Community input is critical to achieving progress on this front, and I am committed to putting into action the ideas derived from the lived experience of Bellevue residents.","I am a strong supporter of our public schools, and I am dedicated to addressing the disparities in education we see affecting people of color and low-income communities. We must close the education gap, reduce our reliance on antiquated practices of punishment that drive over-criminalization, and provide both the resources and individual attention all students need to thrive.

In my position, I will continue working with our Bellevue School District to best determine how we can support our schools, including supplemental funding for programs that help Bellevue kids. We need to look beyond just the classroom and ensure kids have places they can go to learn and succeed when the school day ends. Access to childcare, early learning, and after school care have similar racial disparities, and I’ll work as Mayor to increase equitable access to these programs, which put children on the best path to success. Investing in our children is necessary to ensure a prosperous future for all, and I will continue to prioritize this if re-elected.","As biometrics and AI technology continue to develop, I believe we should limit their use with a goal of preventing unnecessary and abusive practices. The potential for abuse and over surveillance of people of color and other marginalized communities is real and well documented. Technologies like facial recognition software have been statistically shown to exhibit bias. As such, we should not be using this technology in police departments or to surveil the general public. I’ll continue to work with community leaders and technology experts to determine the most appropriate uses for technology that don’t interfere with civil rights.","I have a strong relationship with the Muslim community in my city and the region. I am involved with MAPS, attend their annual dinners, and maintain relationships with our local Imans and female leadership. I also participate in many of the food drives sponsored by i-SERV. I am friends with many Muslims and promote their involvement with local government. I am also reaching out to this community for voter support during my campaign."

It takes concrete steps to confront racialized wealth inequality, re-invigorate the office of economic development to help small neighborhood businesses, and raising wages and protections for workers.

Our city can be a place where every community has economic security and everyone thrives,
together. With effective, progressive leadership in the Mayor’s office, Seattle can do better. We will work to ensure our communities have the resources they need and that we have excellent infrastructure for our small businesses and working people to thrive.

I have also championed funding to support the immigrant community in a rapidly changing landscape under a Trump Administration and established a permanent Legal Defense Fund to help defend immigrants from the Trump’s Administration’s deportation assaults.","As a civil rights lawyer for more than a decade, I worked tirelessly to get justice for victims of police violence and racially biased policing across Washington and Seattle. We need real police accountability that meets this civil rights moment, and we need leaders with a track record to implement it.  

Armed law enforcement should not be responding to a mental health crisis or a non-violent situation. This is not only an unnecessary use of resources but too often results in needless death and trauma in our Black, brown, and indigenous communities. 

My administration will work to shift funds away from SPD toward programs like the Health One Mobile units, the Crisis Response Team, alternative community safety programs like Community Service Officers. I will bring together community, council and labor to ensure that the next contract with the police officer’s guild includes critical components of the 2017 Police Accountability Ordinance.","Over-policing of Black and brown communities is a serious problem in our neighborhoods and our schools. I have worked to shift funding away from SPD and implement participatory budgeting where communities will have funds to determine how to spend funds in a way that best meets their needs.

We have a housing shortage in SeaTac and it is necessary for our city council to build affordable housing, but also listen to the community about how and where that housing should be built. I know motivated and inspired voters create the change we need. I will work to do direct outreach to students, seniors, immigrants, low-income families, and limited English-fluent community members and inform them about social resources, opportunities for political engagement, and learn from them about the change they want to see. To get there, our city council needs to address our community’s basic needs and ensure accessibility to meetings - whether that is translators, a change in meeting scheduling, or providing childcare. Addressing our community member’s basic needs will be a substantive step in providing housing security to hundreds of families in our city.","A first step is recognizing and naming the atrocities happening across our region and city. Moving ahead with this recognition diminishes the violence and racism happening and I know members of our BIPOC communities want to see leadership tackling this head on. Next, I would provide reporting tools through social workers to help our community members find spaces to discuss this violence and report those perpetrating it. I will be a fierce advocate for standing strong against these issues and going directly in our community to stand in solidarity alongside those most affected. ","The decision to terminate the contract with King County Sheriff’s Office has no clear plan to ensure we are moving forward equitably and fiscally responsible. Emerging from a pandemic with hundreds of families behind on rent and food insecure, our city council should be investing their time and financial resources towards community programs like rental assistance and food banks. Without a clear vision as to what is next for policing in SeaTac, we need city council members that understand the harm of over-policing, meet regularly with those affected by it, and move forward with equity and justice. We should be transitioning funds towards public housing, community spaces, food programs, and mental health services, rather than building a new police department.","Far too many of these families are burdened by higher rent prices and inequitable access to schools in the area. I am excited to work with colleagues on city council to build bridges (physical and metaphorical) to give our low-income neighbors access to schools that best fit their students. As a parent raising a 5 year old through our public schools - I strongly encourage dual-language immersion schools that not only promote a second language for students, but are proven to increase cultural and social competency with different communities. Further, our students of color need to be able to see teachers that represent their experiences, family dynamics, and unique lived-experiences to promote inclusivity.","I support implementing policies that are forward thinking around this topic. I know our council needs strong leadership on technological equity issues - whether that's access to computers, reliable internet, or discriminatory AI technologies. I look forward to being proactive about these issues and requiring community involvement when these issues are on the council's table. ",My campaign has centered Muslim experiences throughout all of our outreach. We work closely with current councilmembers to ensure we are doing culturally relevant outreach to our Muslim neighbors. This can be translating our campaign material or more accurately communicating our campaign platform to meet their specific needs.

As a public school social worker, I know our families need food and housing support and we should be spending our funds to help them during the economic impacts from this crisis. My main goal is ensuring our families in our city have the job, food, and housing security to call SeaTac home. ","SeaTac is emerging from the pandemic with a rise in population, particularly low-income BIPOC community members that have been pushed out of downtown Seattle. We need to build a social infrastructure that provides public housing, mental health services, rapid transit, and food programs to ensure each and everyone of our community members have their basic needs met. Addressing poverty through over-policing is bad policy and directly affects generations of families in SeaTac. Our community will be safer when we have a city council that understands the needs of our working families and provides direct support to them. On this journey, we should empower our community members to have direct engagement with their city council through a robust community council program. Too many of our immigrant, low-income, BIPOC neighbors feel disenfranchised from politics; by providing them a seat at the table, we can begin changing that narrative. ","Our priorities as a city council should be providing our community a safe place to live, walkaround, and explore. We often criminalize low-income BIPOC community members through underfunding social programs and restrictive policies that prevent our community from thriving. I oppose any effort that focuses on funding punitive measures for homelessness, food insecurity, and mental health issues rather than funding programs that address the root of those issues. I oppose the decision to discontinue contracting the King County Sheriff's office, but will work with council members and our community leaders to develop strong oversight of the police services in SeaTac. Regardless of whether its King County sheriff's or SeaTac law enforcement, our city council should be focused on funding food banks, parks, community spaces, transit, and affordable housing/rental assistance. ","Working in our public schools as a social worker, I intimately understand the issues facing all our families everyday - particularly our families of color and low-income. I know that they need human and social resources to provide food, rental, mental health, employment, and transportation assistance. These programs are often overlooked and underfunded, but are integral to hundreds of students and their families. As our community grows, it is essential that we encourage our whole community to thrive, giving a chance to many immigrants and BIPOC community members to establish opportunities for their community members. I know we need to enhance our Human Services department at the city and should be building partnerships with nonprofits and other organizations to augment our capacity for our education system to develop equitably. ","I agree and support the use of technology to enhance our lives, but am conscious of its regular misuse towards BIPOC community members. I support developing and enforcing policies that limit law enforcement's ability to abuse this technology and will require community oversight before any AI technology funded by the city is implemented. ","My campaign has been intentional about meeting our Muslim neighbors where they are. We regularly canvass at predominantly immigrant apartment buildings, have community meetings at Muslim community centers, and often translate our campaign material to make it more accessible to our Muslim community members. "
9/7/2021 17:04:46,Teresa Mosqueda,info@teamteresa.org,teamteresa.org,Seattle City Council Position 8,"The way we recover is through a public health approach that prioritizes the health and wellbeing of our most vulnerable and hardest hit communities. I have run a values-based campaign, grounded in my desire to make Seattle a more equitable place. Many of the problems that Seattle needs to address were exacerbated by COVID and stem from inequity and injustice, including housing instability, lack of access to comprehensive health services, poverty wages, and lack of adequate revenue to serve a growing population. I want to go deeper than putting a band-aid on these problems: I want to end them at their source. Since taking office, I led the passage of JumpStart Seattle, the most progressive revenue proposal to pass City Council. I was able to secure worker protections through the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, Gig Driver minimum wage and paid sick leave, hotel  worker protections and healthcare - all of which are especially important during these unprecedented times. As Chair of the Housing Committee, I was able to focus on securing more funding for building and acquiring affordable housing. As Chair, I secured $20 million per year towards the Equitable Development Initiative for communities most at risk of displacement. Additionally, I have prioritized health, safety, and well-being over investments in systems that cause disproportionate harm to our Black and Brown communities. I am proud of these accomplishments, however there is much more that needs to be done to reverse that harm that has been caused, and I am ready to step up to the plate. I prioritized cash assistance through federal relief dollars directly to immigrants and working families. 
I make policy by bringing folks to the table that are most affected by the issue in order to have them drive policy decisions and shape strategies and outcomes. It is not my job to tell people what they need, it is my job to listen to what they need and create policy stemming from community-driven solutions.","It’s even more important now, many folks who have been hardest hit by this pandemic-- workers, immigrants, BIPOC communities-- have needed language access tools and this is our wake up call as a city to get behind improving our targeted outreach to communities for emergency relief, education, workplace opportunities, and more using culturally specific language tools and translations. The recent uptick in racist violence and harassment against these communities has been appalling, and building trust with other communities and working to stop such violence and rebuild safety is essential for the future. ​​On City Council, I have made sure that our committees and full council have access to simultaneous and consecutive translation over the years. However, sporadic translation and interpretation is not enough. I am currently working on a council-wide plan through my office and the council president to make the translation and interpretation services systematized and available all the time. I have fought to make sure that those with multiple languages on staff get compensated extra in the city contract so that knowledge and skill is paid for.  The ability to thrive in school, work, or your local government should not be contingent on your English proficiency and we must do better to create the environment for all language-speakers to have access to important government services, job opportunities, education access, and social integration. ","No one in our community should feel unsafe calling 911, but the senseless murders of those listed above is exactly why people fear the cops and why we need more then just reform. Holding police responsible for their actions and rebuilding trust with impacted communities by redirecting funding upstream into what creates stable, safe, housed communities - is what essential for creating increased public safety. My solutions to address these issues include:
Scoping our armed police force response to matters that require police attention and not to situations that should have a social worker or case manager;   
Investing in mental health support, housing options, and equitable work opportunities that lessen the chance an individual will encounter police or the legal system by creating additional stability. 
Redirect funding to programs that decriminalize poverty, homelessness and addiction, and invest in policies that promote healing through community-oriented policing solutions. 
Redirecting mental health calls away from 911 armed officer responses, and to the health-focused firefighter response teams, including Health One, and community led solutions for calls that may pose a risk of self-harm or danger to others based on behavioral indicators.
Advance more multidisciplinary co-responder crisis teams that include mental health professionals, social workers, and crisis counselors.
","As Budget Chair and as a member of the Seattle City Council - we have the power to invest in all the public policies that make kiddos succeed in school and be healthy. While we don’t invest in the school districts funding allocations, we invest in building affordable housing, ensuring food security, early learning investments 0-5 so kiddos show up ready and able to learn, workplace protections, raises in wage and benefit standards, health housing inspections, rental assistance, and homelessness services that keep families together. That’s what we should be investing in - and that’s what I’ve focused on while on council and will continue to do more if re-elected. We have the power to invest in the social determinants of health along the age spectrum that make it possible to mitigate and fill budget gaps from the inequitable public school funding mechanism. 
Further, diversity in public schools also relates to diverse pathways to success. Each child is different and I support the many routes our bright students can take. Promoting post-secondary education routes such as union apprenticeships, trade school, and community colleges can expand the breadth of options available for upward mobility and economic stability through further, more affordable education if a student so chooses to continue schooling.","Biometric and AI technologies should not be used to surveil people as we know the consequences of this is unjustified overpolicing of people of color, immigrants and refugees, and other marginalized groups. I do not support the use of AI and other technologies by the police department nor do I see any place for them in the city of Seattle. Racist harassment of vulnerable groups can not be given a new outlet via dangerous biometric and AI technologies. The gross misuse of something as powerfully monitoring and overstepping technology can be used to further the inequities in our communities as privacy becomes yet another privilege other communities have over others. I cannot see these violations being justified in our city.","I’ve dedicated my career to bringing diverse perspectives to the table, building broad coalitions, and getting results. That is the only way to rebuild trust among communities who have underserved and underrepresented for too long. That is also the only way to achieve real and lasting results -- through community-driven solutions. I have continued this practice on the campaign trail by working with a number of groups in the Seattle area and beyond to ensure we are capturing the voice of every stakeholder in this upcoming election like One America Votes who offer language accessible forums. I look forward to working with CAIR and other members of the community to promote policy ideas that address the injustices that often Muslim communities are targeted by and also lift up the reliance and policy solutions within Muslim communities as well. "
9/5/2021 17:50:20,Nikkita Oliver (they/them/theirs),nikkita@nikkita4nine.com,www.nikkita4nine.com,Seattle City Council City-Wide Position 9,"Our priorities are built around working peoples--especially the most vulnerable. As we emerge from the pandemic, the health & needs of our most vulnerable residents must dictate our recovery. 

Evictions are a public health crisis. Moratoriums on evictions coupled with renters protections, cash rental assistance programs with enough funding to meet the need, food vouchers, & free transportation options will aid workers as we recover from the pandemic. We must expand pre-filing preventive programs diverting landlords & tenants to rental assistance, technical support for payment plans, & rent forgiveness programs, & tax & fee forgiveness programs for small landlords who demonstrate that they are passing the savings on to renters.

Funding affordable, if not free, public transportation. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the city was able to make public transportation free. If we can make public transportation free when we are facing a budget deficit, we can make it free when we are not. Free and reliable public transit is especially important to immigrant communities & communities of color. Many Black & brown folks have been displaced from Seattle due to exorbitant housing costs & continue to rely on transit to get to work. 

Childcare. Many workers live in childcare deserts. We need to prioritize the development of more unionized childcare throughout the city. We need to expand our childcare assistance programs, early childhood education and assistance program, & the Seattle preschool program. 

Affordable housing. In its first year, it will be directed towards COVID-19 recovery & in its second year, the funding will go towards affordable housing weatherization (which will decrease utility costs for low-income families and elders) & retrofitting.
Utility support. In addition to weatherization, providing utility support will support workers & families in not being weighed down by unpaid utility bills. ","Strategies that focus on genuine prevention, collective accountability, community collaborations, and healing are the most effective in addressing hate-motivated violence. 

1. Acknowledge and condemn violent hate when it occurs. I personally have experienced both extreme targeting and violence in real life and online. Regularly, people send messages through my website regarding my gender and my race. I have been approached on the street before. I think it is important to acknowledge this harm when it occurs and let people know that it is wrong. We must not be bystanders when harm occurs; which many training our communities on intervention strategies and responses.

2. Create and strengthen anti-discrimination bodies, human rights organizations and community organizing. These bodies should have the authority to address hate and violence through monitoring, reporting and assistance to survivors.

3. Conduct outreach and education efforts to Seattle communities to reduce fear and support survivors (this includes survivor support groups) and encourage reporting to anti-discrimination bodies.

4. Survivor support groups that are funded by the City and organized by impacted communities.

5. School-based programs. We teach sex education we should also have school based programs that combat bigotry and hate.

6. Support community collaborations and organizing such as the China-Town International District, MAPS-AMEN, CAIR and/or the NAACP.

7. Increase community presence, events, opportunity, street lighting and preventive safety features in areas where it is known or likely that hate-motivated violence is likely to occur.","Everyone deserves a public health & safety system that works for them. 

We’re in a situation where policing & criminalization drain resources & put Black, Native & People of Color’s lives at risk. Seattle severely under-funds human needs like housing, childcare, food programs & other essential services. Meanwhile, spending on our militarized, bloated policing & criminalization systems is off the charts. While residents face housing costs that have skyrocketed in recent years & mounting unemployment, last year the City spent over $400 million on policing. The City’s past budgets have not represented a commitment to public safety & well-being, they have represented a commitment to racist policing.

Seattle also spends enormously on Seattle municipal court, a place primarily dedicated to processing homeless people into jail. All across the system, from who gets arrested, to who experiences pretrial detention, to what sentences are determined by courts, to who gets deported, the system is targeted at Black people, people of color, indigenous people, women, people with disabilities, & queer & trans people.

Common sense tells us people are safer when they have housing & income, when they have reliable childcare, when they can access health care including mental health support & drug treatment that is culturally competent. None of these things are guaranteed in our region right now–in fact people are facing less & less access to these necessities as housing costs have soared & unemployment has increased. If we really care about well-being, & about defending Black lives, we would start by fully funding human needs.

We must build strategies for responding to emergencies that actually work. When people are having mental health crises, mental health workers, not armed police, are what they need. Meeting basic needs & developing, strengthening, and growing prevention & intervention systems for the whole of the City will make a safer city for everyone.
","As a City Councilmember, I will have limited reach over Seattle Public School (if any). SPS & the City are two separate bureaucracies. That being said, I will have influence over the Department of Education and Early Learning’s budget -- which, through grants and other funding relationships, supports work in Seattle Public School, non-governmental education organizations, and the Seattle Promise Program.

One of the main ways the City of Seattle is officially connected to the Seattle Public Schools is through the Education Levy funds. We want to explore mechanisms for a participatory budgeting process with the education levy funds that put Black, Native, Brown, Muslim-led organizations at the table for directing levy dollars. We also want to decouple levy funding from any high-stakes standardized testing requirements as we know that standardized testing was a product of the white supremacist eugenics movement and still works to maintain racial inequities today.

I helped organize and participated in the “Black Education Now!” rally that was co-sponsored by KCEN during the summer of 2020.  I supported all ten demands of Black Education Now: 1) Community Schools, 2) Restorative Justice, 3) Black Studies and Ethnic Studies, 4) Hire Black teachers, 5) Anti-Racists Professional Development, 6) Accountability, 7) Student Representation, 8) Youth Achievement Center, 9) Community Control of Schools, and 10) Community Control of Education Resources and Levy Funds.

While there are many ways that the City of Seattle and the Seattle Public Schools are separate entities, we also know there are more opportunities for collaboration than are currently being utilized and we also know that there are key areas of overlap where policy must change. I look forward to being a legislator who can help lead these collaborative efforts. 
","Seattle has passed some of the strongest surveillance transparency & accountability protections in the country. CB 119218, Seattle’s Surveillance Ordinance, outlines a specific process for new technology that meets the criteria for surveillance (including a surveillance impact report).

Technology meeting the criteria should have clear contracts: publicly available, any 3rd parties should agree in writing to follow our surveillance tech ordinances, resulting protections & guidelines, there should be clearly defined purposes & retention rules, & all surveillance technology should be subject to independent audit systems to ensure there is no abuse.

It is essential to follow the lead of the community. CAIR-WA, in coalition with organizations such as MAPS-AMEN & ACLU-WA, identified surveillance technologies requiring restrictions. Specifically, as it pertains to Seattle Police Department, there are at least 5 SPD technologies that were recently in the SIR review process.

All ALPR systems utilized w/in the City should be subject to: providing the public w/lists detailing the # of scans, the scans, when information was deleted, any “associated” crimes & the impacts of ALPR in “solving” crimes, any revenue generated from “hits”, & detailed demographic information of which neighborhoods, communities, & people upon whom ALPR is used. Lastly, such use of technology should be subject to regular independent audits & such information should also be made publicly available.

Ultimately, the City of Seattle needs better ways for monitoring, auditing & managing the use of surveillance technologies in all city departments. The information we maintain on residents & how we obtain this information is a civil liberties issue that deeply impacts all marginalized communities but can especially harm our Muslim & undocumented communities. I look forward to working with CAIR-WA & their other coalition partners to develop and bring legislation that addresses these very serious issues. ","In the past, I have worked closely with organizers like Aneelah Afzali and partnered with organizations such as CAIR-WA and MAPS-AMEN on community organizing to support and uplift our Muslim community members. During Ramadan, I have attended Iftar meals to break fast with our Muslim siblings and communities. I have organized with our Muslim neighbors. For example, during the time of “the Muslim ban,” I worked alongside many of our Muslim residents and community organizations to host events, rallies, protests, and sign on letters. I have organizing relationships within the Muslim community from past organizing and solidarity work that I hope will be a strong foundation for our Council office building dynamic and transformative organizing relationship with our Muslim communities."
9/10/2021 11:31:46,Bruce Harrell,info@bruceforseattle.com,BruceForSeattle.com,Seattle Mayor,"I am part of the community of color and have been an active member in communities of color in Seattle for over 40 years. Ensuring an equitable recovery is one of my top priorities as mayor. I’m inspired by stories of creativity and perseverance during the pandemic, but the most important lesson has been that in order for a recovery to work, we must protect workers and keep our smallest businesses from slipping through the cracks. We need leadership and an open door in City Hall, and we must make the most of this moment to make real change on the issues the pandemic has worsened: homelessness, income inequality, gun violence, lack of access to critical services and needs like healthcare. That is why I sponsored Seattle’s Race and Social Justice legislation, requiring an equity lens to policies and investments.   

I have a long history of assisting small, local, and BIPOC-owned businesses get off the ground and turned into thriving job creators and community pillars. As mayor, I’ll be a trusted partner, delivering an equitable recovery with dedicated resources to help businesses get back on their feet and expand to take advantage of opportunities ahead.

On the City Council, I led efforts to ensure all policies are reviewed through an equity lens. As Mayor, I’ll go further creating a Race and Data Initiative to track outcomes and solutions, while also serving as a strong advocate for a holistic recovery that centers underrepresented and BIPOC communities, uses the greatest share of recovery dollars for the greatest challenges we face, passes innovative policies, and brings community to the table to chart our path forward.","As the son of an African American father and Japanese mother, who lived through incarceration by the U.S. government, I know violent, hate-filled acts are not new. I believe representation matters – I would be Seattle’s first Asian and second Black Mayor. I have a unique perspective and real lived experience that has informed my steadfast commitment to and proven record of delivering on equity, inclusion, and racial justice.

Immigrants and refugees are pillars of our community – who have disproportionately faced significant economic and health challenges due to COVID, without the relief and support provided to many others in this country. I was the lead sponsor of the ordinance creating Seattle’s Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs in 2012 – and fought for budget actions that ensured it was funded and staffed. This office has been critical for providing Seattle’s immigrant and refugee communities with dedicated services and support – from helping neighbors become American citizens, to pushing back against the Trump administration’s racist and inhumane immigration policy, to funding news and language access during the pandemic and beyond, so that all communities are informed.

In addition to important guidance from that office, the only way we can make progress on the challenges facing ALL Seattle residents is by listening and acting – seeking input from underrepresented communities and their advocates. I’m excited to once again work with and uplift our immigrant and refugee community – responding to their concerns with proven commitment and real solutions.","This is not a new issue for me – I was the only Seattle City Councilmember to first meet with the family of Native American woodcarver John T. Williams after he was killed by SPD in 2010. I was a dogged supporter of body cameras for all SPD officers. And I led efforts to pass Seattle’s bias-free policing law, prohibiting racial profiling and collecting data to track bias in SPD’s approach.

As Mayor, we’ll take an uncompromising approach to eliminate police bias and brutality. I will advocate for serious culture change, the kind necessary to ensure these broader reforms are both implemented and effective. I’m the only candidate promising to change the way officers approach this effort, working with leaders within the department to expunge racism, champion de-escalation, and fire bad cops who can’t get with the program.

Fixing SPD to ensure public safety for ALL residents – especially Black and Brown Seattleites – has always been my priority. You can trust this will continue to be a key focus of my administration. As Mayor, I’ll never lose sight of the goal: a Seattle police department that is responsive to community needs, that protects all people and neighborhoods without bias.  They will be held responsible because leaders within the department will champion the change with our community. In other words, my leadership will require them to transform their culture – breaking the code of silence and denouncing police brutality and murders like what happened to George Floyd. No excuses.","Growing up, I saw firsthand how disparate the outcomes are for many students of color in our education system, and I have always been concerned with closing the education gap and ensuring every kid has the support needed to succeed and thrive. I supported Seattle’s universal pre-school initiative. I sponsored and got funding for the test program that later became the Seattle Promise – guaranteed access to higher education for every Seattle kid. 

From cradle to career, we need to give kids the support they need to pursue their full potential. As Mayor, one program I’m very passionate to implement is the race and data initiative, which will – for the first time in Seattle’s history – daylight and organize behavioral data to help determine how Seattle can best address institutional and historic racism. This will be critically important for tracking how our education system can be better designed to ensure equity, fairness, and opportunity.

I am also proposing a mentorship program that, by working with Seattle Public Schools and with our community, will link students with leaders in the community. Through this program students will receive individual attention and support. We must look at education broadly – not just in our schools, but in how our community supports kids and students.","I have spent a great deal of time in the tech sector as an attorney, and, for 12 years on the Seattle City Council, I was the Committee Chair for the Technology department largely based on my experience and my passion to drive change through technology. I received the Broadband Visionary of the Year award by the National Association of Telecommunication Officers and Advisors (NATAO) in 2011 for my technology work.

All this experience has taught me that technology is a powerful tool. It can be a powerful tool to help build equity, or it can be exploited to further systemic inequality – and we must be vigilant toward that potential. We need to look closely at the specifics of the AI and biometric technologies – what are they being used for, and by who? We know facial recognition software has been shown to misidentify people of color at significantly higher rates than white people, and we know technology is built with the inherent biases of its programmers. That’s why I will look at each application individually, with input from leaders in the community, and in the tech space who are also members of those underrepresented and affected communities, to determine how best to apply and implement these kinds of technological developments.","The Muslim community has been a strong part of my base for 12 years. I have visited several Mosques over the years and received the prayers of a local Imam. Prior to running for Mayor, I proudly received the honor of being the attorney for the West African Community Council which primarily provides services to the Muslim community. I received the sole endorsement of the Democrats for Diversity and Inclusion and the Seattle Rideshare Drivers Association which have many prominent members of the Muslim community involved in their efforts. In short, I will be the strongest partner I can be with the Muslim community and during the month of September will be having many gatherings with leaders and members of the Muslim community which are already being scheduled. "
9/9/2021 21:30:30,Tosh Sharp,tosh.sharp@gmail,toshfortukwila.com,Tukwila City Council Pos. 1,"The pandemic has disproportionately hurt workers, small businesses, and our community’s most vulnerable. My priority is to ensure our recovery is swift and equitable, centering on the needs of those who have been the hardest hit; promoting targeted outreach to seniors, veterans, immigrants, and communities of color; and restoring peace of mind for all Tukwila residents.
 
I’m especially passionate about working with our immigrant communities to support their small businesses and help ensure they thrive. Too many small local businesses have closed or are at risk of closing because of the pandemic, and our city must play a role in championing them in our recovery efforts.
 
I’ll seek out the needs of all our communities, ensuring that their input is not just heard, but implemented. Everyone needs to have a voice for this recovery to fully be equitable, including those most often underrepresented. Tukwila is a special place because of our diversity, which is why we need real representation on the City Council with the lived experience and personal connections to drive forward a true recovery for all. I was the first-born son to my mother who was an immigrant from the Philippines and know all too well how hard it is for people like us to get the things we need to survive.
 
We have an opportunity to not only recover from this pandemic but create a more just society at the same time. That’s why my focus will be on strengthening pathways to opportunity and success – whether through new jobs and apprenticeships on public projects, accessible public services that help neighbors thrive, improved transit to get people where they need to go, and more.
","In both individual instances and on a systemic level, racial discrimination negatively impacts many communities in our region and country. I believe the best way to address this issue is to elect representative leaders who challenge stereotypes head on and commit to needed progress on the issues at hand. We also need leaders who strive to connect our communities with the support and resources they need. I will be that leader.

Tukwila has incredible diversity, with many immigrants, refugees, and first-generation Americans, and a significant number of residents who either do not speak English as a first language or at home, or are limited in their English-speaking abilities. That means it’s especially critical that our government be accessible to every member of our community – both resources and services, as well as elections, voting, and council member access – through language programs and alternatives. I’m working on campaign materials in alternate languages, so that every voter can read and reflect on what I stand for, and who I’m fighting for.

As a community leader and volunteer, I’ve built real connections with these communities that will allow me to frequently seek their input. Again, I’ll be accountable, transparent, an accessible Council member – to all Tukwila residents, so that our refugee and immigrant neighbors feel supported and can succeed.
","One of the reasons I chose to get involved in my community was after I was unfairly treated by police. After talking with many of my neighbors, who are predominantly immigrants from East Africa, I heard similar stories to what I had experienced, except worse. People who call Tukwila home have the right to feel and be safe.
 
For this reason, I joined and became Chairman of the Community Oriented Policing Civilian Advisory Board to make our police department more transparent and accountable. I also became Chairman of Tukwila’s Civil Service Commission. I am the only candidate in my race to be on both commissions. I serve on these boards to challenge those city entities and ensure folks like us have a voice. On the City Council, I promise you, I will go even further.
 
The first thing I would do, is make sure that the Chief of Police and the Mayor, because he chooses the Chief, understand that they are solely responsible for the actions of their officers under their command. It is the Chief’s responsibility to ferret out the officers that would put the city and public at risk. That political cover is no longer available, nor can we as a city afford them that protection.
 
I would ask that measures be put in place that prevent poor and sub-standard officers from being hired into our Police force, which starts with increasing the standards demanded by the department and increase the quality of the background checks to achieve that end. I would also focus more resources towards hiring officers right out of the academy so that they can be conditioned to serve Tukwila, in the Tukwila way.
 
I want to focus on attracting the best officers to Tukwila and ensuring community policing, where officers live within the city limits and get to know the community they serve. Finally, we need to further strengthen community oversight, so boards like the ones I serve on can continue to ensure police are accountable when they violate the safety of our community.
 ","Every child deserves a great school and a great education that sets them up for success. The best way I can help achieve this is by serving as a strong partner with our school board and by promoting programs that help drive learning outcomes. Growing up the son of a single mother, who was an immigrant and of color, and working my way through school, I’ve seen how critical public support systems are to a foundation for future learning. Now that I have a son who will be entering this school system, I have a real stake in how our schools develop. Being a father, that experience really focuses you on the priorities of life.

I’ll support efforts to expand access to childcare and early education programs, along with after school care, community programming, and support for organizations that help mentor youth, particularly those from underrepresented communities. As a former apprentice, I’ll prioritize alternative education options and opportunities as well. I’ll also work directly with school board members to look at our curriculum and see how we can further support a great school system for every kid.

As for over-criminalization, I believe we must support diversion programs and mentoring, shifting resources to support alternatives to heavy handed punishment, and instead promoting alternatives for growth and learning that are shown to lead to better outcomes.
","Looking at these new technologies, we need to have thoughtful policies in place that allow us to protect privacy and ensure that the civil rights of all our citizens are not eroded away. We will put forth appropriate measures, to protect our most vulnerable and at-risk communities. 

I support requiring limited programs that include, biometric and/or AI programs that would be used on all communities, especially of color. These underrepresented communities must be protected and strong leaders must make sure they are not abused by such systems. We need to look fully at these kinds of programs, especially those that would be used by law enforcement, comprehensively and critically before putting them into practice on our citizens. You can trust, that I will be a thoughtful and deliberative councilmember on these issues. I will have the strength and the will to fight for yours and my community, even if it means I will be that lone voice on council to do so. 

This is an issue for me that goes beyond politics, you can count on me to fight for you.
 
","The very first neighborhood that I looked to, for support from was the Muslim community. The neighborhood I chose to live in is only a couple of blocks away from the Mosque, and that was by choice. My dearest friends are of Muslim descent. I have made it a priority that my campaign materials be translated into languages that will be easier for these folks to absorb. I have the support of several Muslim leaders in my community including Council member Zak Idan. 

Today, the Muslim community has very few politicians that will actively fight for this community, I am one of the sole individuals who has and will continue to do so. I am one of the only people that spoke out against the several Muslim businesses being destroyed in favor of the Tukwila Justice Center. I was one of the few, that made it clear to those in city leadership, that what happened to the community members here was wrong. You and the folks of our community want change and leadership that not only tells you the truth, but will fight for you. 

So many politicians say what you want to hear, but do not truly understand our problems or actually follow through, that WILL not be me. If you are not getting the representation you deserve, I implore you to hold me accountable. I will be the individual in leadership that will answer you when you call.

9/2/2021 15:09:39,Dennis Martinez,DennisMartinez.tukwila@gmail.com,"P.O. Box 88535 Tukwila, WA 98138",Tukwila City Council Position 3,"As a community activist I am currently working with people of color and immigrants and I am very aware of the shortfalls that fall on my fellow community members. I have always maintained that our city needs to hire more diversity  within there staff, the average hourly wage to live in Tukwila is $25.75 and it's almost imposable to find a single employer willing to pay that kind of wages. the city of Tukwila is on of the largest employers in our city but has one the the fewest minority employees. Each department in the city should have at least 10% minority hire I am of the belief that this is an realistic number that can be obtained and the city does pay very well for permanent positions. Most immigrants and minorities have to work 2 jobs to make ins meet while these good paying city jobs are filled with people that live in other cities. The council should mandate that we have permanent outreach positions for 5 of the majority ethnic cultures to help our members feel more welcomed and not just a number to help. I also believe that the Police Department and Fire department should have at least 2 local minorities/ people of color  in there administration and the mayors office should have 2 as well. Each government agency should lead by example on what our government should look like and our city is no different. It starts with our city first on the  immigrant and people of color recovery     ",Our city hires community connectors for different immigrant communities but they are not full time permanent positions that pay well. I believe that the city should have permanent high paying positions for immigrants and people of color within the mayors office and both the Fire and Police departments to help our community feel at ease when talking about health and other related issues. ,I cannot state this enough we need to have local hire from within our people of color and immigrant communities because we can relate to the concerns of our people. Pier community accountability is the direction I would take.  ,"First what I would do is to engage with the elected school boards and inquire as to what they are doing to promote high paying trades jobs that are in high demand now and have been for the last 10 years. I am a 43 years retired union plumber/pipefitter living on vested union pensions, I am well aware of the opportunities that are available to youth. As a youth mentor I encourage and guide minorities through the apprenticeships that are available to them. I am of the belief that school districts should work in partnership with cities and local infrastructure organizations to hire students right out of school during the summer for internships that turn into apprenticeships when they graduate from high school. A union plumber makes over $70.00 per hour with that wage you can buy a house in Tukwila.   ","I believe that the council can make a difference as a whole but as an individual it would be a hard sell, I know local elected officials will promise the world when they are running for re-election but I have never seen any action from any of the current members when it comes to this topic. City ordinances would be the only way I would know how at a local level.  ","Because of the pandemic I have tried to stay away from group activities as not to endanger my community that I care about. I still work one on one with members that reach out to me as I have always been available to ALL members of my community. I will share with you my family tragedy so you can understand why I am reluctant to do group settings. In  January 2018 I lost my son to influenza ""FLU"" he caught it at Christmas and lost his battle because his lungs filled with fluid. In March of 2020 my wife contracted Covid 19 from contact with a co worker at the fire department where she has worked for 30 years. she has been diagnosed with long haulers symptoms and has been working from home since. I would normally be very active in my community but this is a deadly virus that does hit people of color and immigrants hard, so I am very hesitant on inter acting with my people and hope you can understand my actions.

We recognized an immediate need for rental assistance and utility assistance.  We had a robust program previously but we invested sate, federal and city funds to stabilize families.  In addition we have implemented an Equity and Social Justice Commission to help the city prioritize our investments and efforts centering equity, safety and economic security for the residents of the city.  This included our budget deliberations establishing community townhalls with assistance of working with our partners from Community Based organizations, non-profits, Tukwila Children's foundation and relationships that many councilmembers and staff have developed with our diverse residents including our partner organizations from immigrant and refugee to offer multiple townhalls with targeted population","I was council president last year and I used my platform our city run community paper to write articles encouraging the importance of getting vaccinated.  I also shared my lived experience as I African American and I am aware of the history associated with vaccine hesitancy. I also shared my experience taking my son to get vaccinated. Participated in multiple community gathering speaking out against anti-immigrant, anti-Asian hate and xenophobic behavior because I believe in Tukwila hate has no home here. I will continue to encourage vaccination.  Tukwila did provide multiple language information about vaccinations and testing sites in Tukwila.  We also partnered with King County to offer mobile vaccinations to the AbuBkar Mosque and other institutions.  "," I have dedicated my 12 years on council prioritizing thoughtful investment in Public safety.  I have worked closely with the council to make sure our policies reflect the needs of the community especially I diverse needs of our residents.   I lead the effort to establish a community process for selecting the current chief of police in direct response to accountability.  I have and continue to work towards reimagining safety working since 2015 directly working on the Governor’s Taskforce to end deadly force.  Including my service as a commissioner of the Washington States Criminal Justice Training Commission sitting with community and law enforcement to reimagine policing to de-escalate violent interactions.  Implementing I-940 changes and advancing the 21st Century policing advancements in our system.  I focus on solutions based and accountable approaches to reimaging law enforcement.  We as a society, have a shared responsibility be a part of one another’s interest in safety.   ","I am a champion for funding after school programs through a partnership with the city and the school district.  I also led the effort to establish and fund a teen and senior intergenerational center funding the supportive programs that have disappeared over the last 15 years.  Making this investment was a direct response to making sure to provide opportunities and address inequities in community. The school district and board are a separate body that requires partnership and pursuit of that is something I've done in my years of service.  Overcriminalization occurs and requires a collective response from community, partners, residents, city and regional investments.  I have an establish record of budget investments in human services, behavioral health and mental health investments.  As well as being a champion for Teens for Tukwila programs, teen and youth programs.  ","I am supporter and contributor of a robust policy on Tukwila Police body cams, UAS policy prioritizing residents and individuals personal information.  As a councilmember my responsibility includes oversight and representation of residents city-wide.  This includes review and establishment of policies that do not disproportionately impact, Black, Brown, Native and other marginalized communities.  Engaging directly with residents with diverse lived experiences to make sure perspectives are represented in policy decisions.  ","I have direct relationships with Muslim communities because I sought them and grew them overtime.  I built a strong relationships with residents from Muslim communities, I have participated, attended and supported events at the AbuBakar Mosque invested in street improvements, assisted in addressing communication processes with the city and the Mosque.  Facilitated a townhall regarding issues between law enforcement and issues with ICE detention.  I am advocate for members of the community of Tukwila that include many members of the Muslim faith. I have always sought advice in the past and continue to work to engage the Muslim community.    "
